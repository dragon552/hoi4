POL_expansion_of_new_towns코1=The New Polish Industry
POL_expansion_of_new_towns_desc코1=With the west now reclaimed from the Germans, we must develop the burgeoning industries in cities like Gdynia which are rapidly coming to rival Warsaw in grandeur.
POL_fill_the_railways_gaps코0=Fill The Railways Gaps
POL_fill_the_railways_gaps_desc코1=Poland was once divided between three powers, and as such our rail networks are distant and unconnected. We must unite these three separate railway lines into one if we are to make Poland the centralized industry we need it to become!
POL_start_central_industrial_region코2=Expand Kraków Industries
POL_start_central_industrial_region_desc코2=Poland’s old capital of Kraków has been freed from the clutches of the Austrian Empire, but still the city remains shackled by its past; lacking the modern industries it needs to rival the west. With investment, we shall bring Kraków back from the dead.
POL_expand_central_industrial_region코1=Modernize Galician Industry
POL_expand_central_industrial_region_desc코2=Galicia, like Kraków, was once held and neglected by the Austrians, but now that it is once again in Polish hands, we may give it the investments into modernization that it so desperately needs.
POL_the_four_year_plan코0=The Four Year Plan
POL_the_four_year_plan_desc코1=We must plan for the expansion of our infrastructure to accommodate not only our present industry, but also the future.

POL_develop_upper_silesia코0=Develop Upper Silesia
POL_develop_upper_silesia_desc코1=We control but a small region of Silesia, but that which we do have is of great industrial significance. Silesia is one of the most heavily industrialized regions in our nation, and with a little investment, it could continue to support the further industrialization of our entire nation.
POL_additional_research_slot1코1=Polish School of Mathematics
POL_additional_research_slot1_desc코1=Mathematics is central to almost all things in the technological sector. All across Poland; from Lwów to Warsaw, the mathematical schools are flourishing. We must capitalize on this golden age of Polish thinkers, and grant these men all that they need to make Poland the technological powerhouse it deserves to be!
POL_the_bombe코0=The Bombe
POL_the_bombe_desc코0=The "Cryptologic Bombe" is a development of the Cyclometer, and allows us to decipher the progressively more advanced versions of the German Enigma cipher.
POL_the_cyclometer코0=The Cyclometer
POL_the_cyclometer_desc코0=With this invention, the ciphers of the Germans will become plain as clear text. No secrets will be kept from us.

POL_additional_research_slot2코1=Expand the University of Warsaw
POL_additional_research_slot2_desc코1=Warsaw university is where most of Poland’s greatest minds attend to teach, learn, and broaden Poland’s technological capabilities.

POL_prepare_for_the_next_war코0=Prepare For The Next War
POL_prepare_for_the_next_war_desc코0=The Great War may only have been the first of its kind. We must prepare for what must surely be an ever-changing battlefield.
POL_the_defence_of_poland코0=The Defense Of Poland
POL_the_defence_of_poland_desc코0=Even bolder stratagems must be devised if the defense of our homeland is to succeed.
POL_romanian_bridgehead_strategy코0=Romanian Bridgehead Strategy
POL_romanian_bridgehead_strategy_desc코0=Should the fighting turn against us, we must have plans in place for effective regrouping and retaliation in concert with our friends and allies.

POL_silesia_fortified_area_desc코0=More forts constructed in the south will secure additional defenses.

POL_modernising_the_cavalry코0=Modernizing The Cavalry
POL_modernising_the_cavalry_desc코0=While the cavalry still has a role to play, we need new metal mounts for it to compete on the modern battlefield.

POL_army_modernisation_desc코0=Modern arms for modern men!
POL_air_base_expansion코0=Air Base Expansion
POL_air_base_expansion_desc코0=Airbases are as essential to air support as air support is to modern warfare.
POL_fighter_modernisation코0=Fighter Modernization
POL_fighter_modernisation_desc코0=The mainstay of any air force, our fighters must not be made obsolete. As the rest of our air force improves, so must they.
POL_air_innovations코0=Air Innovations
POL_air_innovations_desc코0=There is still much to be done in the field of aerial strategy and tactics.
POL_heavy_fighter_concept코0=Heavy Fighter Concept
POL_heavy_fighter_concept_desc코0=Should we be forced to go on the offensive, we need a new kind of fighter that can operate at length inside hostile borders.
POL_naval_bomber_experiments코0=Naval Bomber Experiments
POL_naval_bomber_experiments_desc코0=Air supremacy is as important at sea as over land. Specialized aircraft developed for the purpose of naval warfare is a way to achieve that aim.

POL_medium_bomber_focus_desc코0=An extension of the precision bombing philosophy adapted for extended range to be used in support roles.
POL_light_bomber_focus코0=Light Bomber Focus
POL_light_bomber_focus_desc코0=The value of using dive bombers for close air support should not be underestimated.
POL_air_modernisations_programme코0=Air Modernizations Program
POL_air_modernisations_programme_desc코0=Aviation theory is just as important as technology. New stratagems for our pilots are still waiting to be discovered.
POL_rocket_development코0=Rocket Development
POL_rocket_development_desc코0=Speed is the attribute on which all other aerial attributes rely. Rocket and jet engines could theoretically allow us to pass all previous limits.
POL_develop_polish_ship_building코0=Develop Polish Ship Building
POL_develop_polish_ship_building_desc코2=Danzig is hopelessly lost to the vile regime of the Nazi party, and Polish trade must find a way to subvert the effective embargo the Nazis hold over our economy. We may never recover Gdańsk, but perhaps we may be able to turn Gdynia into a great seaport to rival Gdańsk in grandeur.
POL_study_foreign_built_ships코1=Study British Ship Designs
POL_study_foreign_built_ships_desc코1=The British navy has been an ally to Poland for decades, but as of late, Britain’s policy of appeasement puts Poland in a precarious position with no friends to rely on. Perhaps by studying the designs of the Brits, we will be able to begin producing ships of equal efficiency and grandeur.
POL_a_cruiser_navy코0=A Cruiser Navy
POL_a_cruiser_navy_desc코0=Increasingly larger ships will be needed to make a reality of our plans for a sea presence.
POL_import_submarine_technology코1=ORP Orzeł
POL_import_submarine_technology_desc코1=Modern naval warfare is won both above and beneath the waves and if we wish to compete with the U-boats of Germany, we must design and distribute original Polish submarines.
POL_commerce_attack코0=Commerce Attack Tactics
POL_commerce_attack_desc코0=No navy is complete without submarines. Ours need to be organized for optimal lethality, just like the rest of the fleet.
POL_the_twin_threats코1=Resume Naval Modernization
POL_the_twin_threats_desc코1=Now that we have regained control of our coastline, we can resume the modernization of our navy. Victory shall come from studying the methods of naval warfare before committing our industry to anything.
POL_coastal_defense코1=Modest Modernisations
POL_coastal_defense_desc코1=We are a small economy with a small coastline, so the modernization of our navy must be modest. Destroyers are a cheap and efficient way to defend one’s coastline, and we must commit to them.
POL_strike_force코1=The Dragon Ambition
POL_strike_force_desc코2=The Polish navy thus far has been modest and meak in its efforts to modernize, but no more. A great Polish dragon will mount the waves, and both Germans and Russians alike will quake at her roar as she rises like a beast on the horizon!
POL_baltic_navy코1=Guardian of the Baltic
POL_baltic_navy_desc코1=None shall pass by our blocades, none shall land on the shores of Poland or her allies. The baltic sea belongs to Poland, and no others.
POL_strengthen_the_polish_state코0=Strengthen The Polish State
POL_strengthen_the_polish_state_desc코0=We cannot afford to stand divided. Our strength to enact changes is proportional to our unity in both senate and sejm.

POL_polish_militarism코0=Polish Militarism

POL_polish_revanchism코0=Polish Revanchism

POL_poland_first코0=Poland First
POL_poland_first_desc코0=The good of the nation must take precedence to so-called "truths." Just as we forge our own destiny, we must forge our own facts.
POL_ideological_fanaticism코1=Nationalist Education
POL_ideological_fanaticism_desc코1=Countless young minds attend universities across the country, and we are missing a golden opportunity to embed the ideals of the Poland we are building into their minds. Young people should be encouraged to become patriots, fighters, and bulwarks of Polish ideals!
POL_the_between_the_seas_concept코0=The Between The Seas Concept
POL_the_between_the_seas_concept_desc코1=Józef Piłsudski had an ambition for an alliance of nations spanning between the seas; Poles, Romanians, former Commonwealth members, and even Italians working together to ensure their mutual continued survival, without giving an inch on their sovereignty. Now, we stand in a position to fulfill Piłsudski’s daring vision. By reaching out to Romania, we will make the first step in making the Intermarium a reality!
POL_treaty_with_lithuania코0=Treaty With Lithuania
POL_treaty_with_lithuania_desc코0=Old grudges need to stay in the past. Every friend is needed in the dark times ahead.
POL_the_baltic_alliance코1=Alliance With the Baltic States
POL_the_baltic_alliance_desc코0=One can never have enough friends.
POL_internationalism코0=Internationalism
POL_internationalism_desc코0=The enemies of our enemies can be our friends.
POL_authoritarianism코0=Authoritarianism
POL_authoritarianism_desc코0=Democracy is a weak solution to tough problems. If power is to be wielded with force, it must be freed from the shackles of consensus.
POL_paramilitarism코0=Paramilitarism
POL_paramilitarism_desc코0=Military principles have applications outside the military arena. With every part of society trained in these disciplines, every citizen will be able to take up arms at a moment's notice.
POL_go_right코0=Go Right
POL_go_right_desc코0=Strength is the only quality worth pursuing. Our neighbors have embraced this truth, and so must we.
POL_military_youth코0=Military Youth
POL_military_youth_desc코0=Enrolling our young in organizations promoting discipline and national ideology will breed a loyal generation of future recruits.
POL_seek_accommodation_with_germany코0=Seek Accommodation With Germany
POL_seek_accommodation_with_germany_desc코0=Why should we fight, when we are more alike than different?
POL_go_left코0=Go Left
POL_go_left_desc코0=Only by uniting our people can we prevail against the foes that threaten to consume us.
POL_political_commissars코0=Political Commissars

POL_seek_accommodation_with_USSR코0=Seek Accommodation With USSR
POL_seek_accommodation_with_USSR_desc코0=The USSR want war as little as we do. Perhaps there is a way to reconcile our history without bloodshed.
POL_liberalism_focus코1=Liberalism
POL_liberalism_focus_desc코1=We will not stoop to the level of despots and dictators. Never forget that a state serves its people, and not the opposite.
POL_intervention_focus코0=Intervention Focus
POL_intervention_focus_desc코0=If we value freedom, we need to safeguard it not only for us, but for nations everywhere. If this means war, so be it!
POL_draw_closer_to_britain코0=Draw Closer To Britain
POL_draw_closer_to_britain_desc코0=The British have committed to protect our independence in the face of aggressors. We need to make the necessary gestures of appreciation.
POL_volunteer_corps코0=Volunteer Corps
POL_volunteer_corps_desc코0=Freedom cannot be enforced by the unwilling, or it would become a travesty. Those who take arms for liberty by choice must be given the means to do so, however.
POL_militarism_focus코0=Polish Militarism
POL_authoritarianism_focus코0=Authoritarianism
POL_polish_revanchism_focus코0=Polish Revanchism
POL_slavic_revanchism코0=Polish Revanchism

POL_central_defence_of_poland코0=Central Defence of Poland
POL_central_defence_of_poland_desc코0=Poland is lacking the equipment it needs to defend against the countless threats to her border. By expanding the Ministry of National Defence, we will be better equipped to fight any army who seeks to brutalize Poland under an occupation.
POL_modernize_congressional_factories코0=Modernize Congressional Factories
POL_modernize_congressional_factories_desc코0=Congress Poland was the largest and most unified region of our nation and it holds the greatest potential for growth in all of Poland. By modernizing major cities like Warsaw, we will turn Congress Poland into the industrial heart of our nation.
POL_expand_katowice_mines코0=Expand Katowice Resources
POL_expand_katowice_mines_desc코1=Despite its relative small size, Upper Silesia is a treasure trove of steel and aluminium. Although it would be ideal to control the entirety of Silesia, we must for now exploit the Upper Silesian industries to their fullest.
POL_abolish_segregated_seating코0=Abolish Segregated Seating
POL_abolish_segregated_seating_desc코0=Poland is a landscape of people of different ethnicities, cultures, and faiths, yet in our education we keep them separate. If they truly are all Poles, then they should be together and share ideas freely. Segregated seating is little but a constraint on our education and must be abolished.
POL_agrarian_reform코0=Agrarian Reform
POL_agrarian_reform_desc코2=A peasant’s strike is on the horizon. All across the country, food prices are skyrocketing, and both our disjointed industry and the government’s lack of action to aid Poland’s poorest cause great unrest in the peasantry. With sufficient investment and reform however, we should be able to become more than capable of meeting the peasants’ demands.
POL_invest_in_eastern_poland코0=Invest in Eastern Poland
POL_invest_in_eastern_poland_desc코0=The east is a barren and desolate place, neglected entirely by both the Russians and the Polish state. There is a plethora of ideal locations for factories, and plenty of men with which to work them, should we choose to invest in such things.
POL_complete_the_plan코0=Complete the Plan
POL_complete_the_plan_desc코0=The time has come to reflect upon the Four Year Plan and prepare plans for the next four years of Polish industrialization! The more we have invested in Poland and her industry, the better prepared we will be for what lurks in Poland’s industrial future.
POL_woo_the_sanation_generals코0=Woo the Sanation Generals
POL_woo_the_sanation_generals_desc코0=The Sanationist military staff are disgruntled and disloyal towards the regime. Some would say that a purge of military staff is necessitated by the Sanation’s own hubris, but we know these men are simply too valuable to be replaced.
POL_sanationist_army코0=A Sanationist Army
POL_sanationist_army_desc코0=With a loyal Sanation upper command under our control, the time has come to utilize the old guard’s experience among the troops.
POL_purge_the_sanation코0=Purge the Sanation
POL_purge_the_sanation_desc코0=The Sanation generals are fickle and disloyal and have proved themselves to have allegiances moreso to themselves than to Poland herself! We must purge our high command of all generals involved in the Sanation coup!
POL_appoint_new_officers코0=Appoint New Officers
POL_appoint_new_officers_desc코0=Now that our military staff has been purged of disloyal generals, we have the opportunity to give power to men who care deeply about Polish sovereignty, and hold no loyalty to the Castle, Left, or Right.
POL_new_military_academy코0=New Military Academy
POL_new_military_academy_desc코0=Our high command lays barren and empty, but this leaves a golden opportunity to plant the seeds for the future; ensuring that future generals are loyal to our nation and highly educated in the art of war. By funding military academies across the nation, we will ensure that any new Polish officers are of a higher caliber than any of their predecessors.
POL_attract_foreign_motors코0=Attract Foreign Motor Companies
POL_attract_foreign_motors_desc코0=While some would insist that the original Polish designs of LRL are where the future of Polish motorized equipment lies, the question remains why should we reinvent the wheel when we can merely realign it? Foreign motor companies have mastered the art of making materials cheaper, faster, and harder so it would seem prudent to invite them to design equipment for us!
POL_adaptive_designs코0=Adaptive Designs
POL_adaptive_designs_desc코0=Maintaining our licence for foreign designers is coming to be of great expense to the state, but perhaps there are ways we can repurpose our military designs to be of use in the private sector. By distributing a portion of our materials to the wealthy, we may mitigate the cost of maintaining the expense of employing these foreign design companies.
POL_complete_april_constitution코0=Complete the April Constitution
POL_complete_april_constitution_desc코0=The April Constitution is a series of reforms designed to centralize Poland into a more centralized authoritarian regime under the President. The Sanation government is legitimized by this legislation, but still there are those who long for the old system. The April Constitution must be completed and amended to further the powers of [ROOT.GetLeader] and centralize the Polish state!
POL_consolidate_sanation_government코0=Consolidate the Sanation Government
POL_consolidate_sanation_government_desc코1=Since the death of Józef Piłsudski, the Sanation government has been fragmented and disorganized. The government has split into three branches: The Castle, the Sanation Left, and the Sanation Right. It’s uncertain if the Castle can maintain control of the dictatorship, but the government must leave this state of indecision soon if it is to have any hope of withstanding the oncoming storm of war.
POL_the_castle코0=The Castle
POL_the_castle_desc코0=The Castle represents the governors ruling from Warsaw Castle under the leadership of Ignacy Mościcki. Staunch supporters of the status quo, giving support to the government in the Castle will keep the nation stable and prevent the Sanations left and right from having the necessary footing to instigate a coup.
POL_eliminate_socialist_parties코0=Eliminate Socialist Parties
POL_eliminate_socialist_parties_desc코0=Socialism is an ideology rapidly taking hold of the world, but it is fundamentally incompatible with the ideals of the Castle government. The left oppose us in both the form of agrarian and social-democrat parties, and in the traitorous communist parties. Socialism of all forms must not be accepted and all social parties must be banned for the sake of the continued stability and security of the Polish state.
POL_dissolve_the_sejm코0=Dissolve the Sejm
POL_dissolve_the_sejm_desc코0=The Sejm has continued to exist under the Sanation government as a mere token of the democracy Poland once embraced. The time has come however to strip the Sejm of all powers and grant all power to the Senate and the Senators of the Castle.
POL_promote_chemical_industry코0=Support the Chemical Industry
POL_promote_chemical_industry_desc코0=Before the days of the Sanation government, Ignacy Mościcki was an intellectual and a chemist. Now, at the head of the Polish state, Mościcki stands in a position where he may support the chemical industry and the study thereof.
POL_camp_of_national_unity코0=Maintain the Dictatorship
POL_camp_of_national_unity_desc코0=The Sanations Left and Right no longer possess the power to be a real threat to the government and all that remains is to officially dissolve them and maintain the leadership of Ignacy Mościcki and guide Poland into a new brighter future.
POL_the_sanation_left코0=The Sanation Left
POL_the_sanation_left_desc코1=Loyal to Walery Sławek, the Sanation Left represents those who feel Sławek is the true successor to Piłsudski and seek accommodation with the opposition, rather than ostracising them from government entirely as the Right and Castle would. Though cooperation with them will likely upset the Sanation Right, the leftists hold internal power that we need to build a competent cabinet of ministers.
POL_modus_vivendi코0=Modus Vivendi
POL_modus_vivendi_desc코0=The Sanation Left seeks accommodation with the opposition within our state; granting them seats of power within the government. With members of the opposition given proper representation, they may no longer seek to oppose the Dictatorship.
POL_draft_a_new_constitution코0=Draft a New Constitution
POL_draft_a_new_constitution_desc코0=It has long been Sławek’s ambition to amend the constitution of Poland, and given the right to do so may grant us more direct control over the Polish state and further improve the April Constitution.
POL_department_for_home_defence코0=Department for Home Defence
POL_department_for_home_defence_desc코0=Poland has long lacked the home defence it needs to defend against the enemies on either side of our borders. By establishing the Department for Home Defence, we will master the methods of war necessary to defend our state.
POL_legion_of_merit코0=The Legion of Merit
POL_legion_of_merit_desc코0=A conception of Walery Sławek, the Legion of Merit would award a privileged position to any citizens of the republic who have proven themselves to be of outstanding benefit to the state. The award would guarantee the individual a position in the senate, and any individual invited to the Legion would certainly have little reason to grow disgruntled with the regime.
POL_the_left_chairman코0=The Left Chairman
POL_the_left_chairman_desc코0=The Sanations Left and Right are fundamentally incompatible ideologically. While we may be able to benefit from reforms proposed by the Right, it is the Left who has the best interests of Poland at heart and perhaps by granting them greater powers, we may sideline the Right entirely…
POL_common_organization_of_society코0=Common Organization of Society
POL_common_organization_of_society_desc코0=Sławek has long had the ambition to replace the BBWR with a power structure he calls the “Common Organization of Society”. This structure would uniquely grant great local autonomy to Poland’s states and townships, while centralizing the government in a strong authoritarian regime ready to interfere in local governance in times of war. With the Left in power, Sławek may at last fulfill his ambition.
POL_dissolve_the_bbwr코0=A New King in the Castle
POL_dissolve_the_bbwr_desc코0=The Left have grown so influential and powerful within the Dictatorship that Mościcki’s title of President seems entirely symbolic at best. All that remains is to make it official and disband all traces of the Castle from government, bringing Sławek to the lofty peak of power in the state.
POL_the_sanation_right코0=The Sanation Right
POL_the_sanation_right_desc코0=Followers of Edward Rydz-Śmigły, the Sanation Right is primarily composed of generals and high ranking military staff. The military powerhouse of the Sanation government, the Right are in prime position to take control of the government, but granting powers and concessions to them may ensure their continued loyalty and potential incorporation into the Castle.
POL_support_right_paramilitaries코0=Support Right-Wing Paramilitarism
POL_support_right_paramilitaries_desc코0=The Falangists of Poland’s political landscape have often been described as fanatical, fascist, and even comparable with the Nazis, but their rhetoric is appealing to Polish patriots, and Jerzy Rutkowski proposes establishing a paramilitary composed of youthful volunteers ready to fight and die for Polish independence.
POL_codify_national_unity코0=Codify the Camp of National Unity
POL_codify_national_unity_desc코0=The Camp of National Unity represents the joint interests of the Sanation Right and the Castle, and thus far the policies and goals of the group have been vague. However, we may amend the April Constitution to lock our values of nationalism, law and order, and anti-communism into the foundation of our republic.
POL_second_man_of_the_state코0=Second Man of the State
POL_second_man_of_the_state_desc코0=The Sanation Left has been sufficiently sidelined and now, Śmigły and Mościcki are able to completely oust the Left of all influence in the government. Śmigły shall be made the “second man”, meaning that in times of war, Mościcki must surrender his seat as President to the Sanation Right and the military.
POL_ozon코1=Triumph of OZN
POL_ozon_desc코0=Though the agreement is that Mościcki surrenders his seat in times of war, it is clear that the threats on our border are more than we can stand against and war is on the horizon. With Śmigły in total control of the nation, our military and civilian governments will be one and we will be ready to fight whomever threatens Polish sovereignty.
baltic_security_opinion코0=Protecting Baltic Security
POL_align_with_the_west코0=Align with the West
POL_align_with_the_west_desc코0=The British, French, and other western powers have long been stalwart defenders of Polish sovereignty so we would do well to keep our nation aligned with them.
POL_lithuanian_ultimatum코0=Lithuanian Ultimatum
POL_lithuanian_ultimatum_desc코0=For years, we have officially been in a state of war with the Lithuanians though nobody has taken aggressive action since the annexation of Vilnius. With Germany storming across the continent taking what it desires with the mere threat of war, perhaps we may do the same for Lithuania; demanding an end to these hostilities for the sake of both our nations.
POL_lithuanian_alliance코0=Lithuanian Alliance
POL_lithuanian_alliance_desc코0=We have made peace with our former enemies to the north, but now we must learn how to move forward together as friends. Our enemies and allies are common, so it is only natural that the Lithuanians be aligned with the same powers as us.
POL_lithuanian_annexation코0=Demand Lithuanian Annexation
POL_lithuanian_annexation_desc코0=With the German anschluss of Austria, it’s become evident that old unions can be restored if one merely asks for it with some aggression. Perhaps we may suggest that the Lithuanians would be much safer if they lived in a larger more powerful state… Poland, for example.
POL_restore_the_sejm코0=Restore the Sejm
POL_restore_the_sejm_desc코0=Implementing the April Constitution was clearly a mistake in need of rapid correction. Power must be returned to the Sejm, and from there we must decide the future of our nation through democratic means.
POL_plan_west코0=Plan West
POL_plan_west_desc코0=The Axis are breathing down our neck. Though some within the government believe our relationship with [GER.GetLeader] to be cordial, we know that the Germans cannot be trusted and extensive plans in the west are necessary to securing Poland’s future.
POL_the_prusya_line코1=The Prussian Line
POL_the_prusya_line_desc코0=East Prussia is a key invasion point for the Germans, and a great gap in our current defences. By expanding out fortline along the Prussian border, our armies will be more capable of defending our nation from the threat to our north.
POL_invest_anti_air코0=Invest in Anti-Air
POL_invest_anti_air_desc코0=We are unlikely to be capable of outproducing the Germans in the air, however we need not outnumber them when we can instead invest heavily in constructing anti-air weaponry on the ground. With Bofors in every state, German pilots won’t get far before meeting our guns.
POL_the_prusya_army코1=The Prussian Guard
POL_the_prusya_army_desc코0=Our border with Prussia is woefully undefended. All of our investments in the Prussian fortifications will mean nothing without soldiers manning the forts.
POL_expand_poznan_forts코0=Expand Poznan Forts
POL_expand_poznan_forts_desc코0=Poznan is already home to a plethora of bunkers and key defensive structures, but there is much room for improvement. Poznan is the first line of defence against the enemy and must be defended, regardless of the cost.
POL_local_western_plans코0=Local Western Plans
POL_local_western_plans_desc코0=There are key strategic regions all along the Polish-German border. Drafting comprehensive plans on a purely local level and executing them at the right time is as necessary for the continued survival of the Polish state as our grander battle plans.
POL_sudeten_mountaineers코0=Sudeten Mountaineers
POL_sudeten_mountaineers_desc코0=The Sudetenland is an insecure border, but it also provides a unique defensive position. By training men who have mastered mountain warfare, we will be able to outmaneuver the Germans in the lofty peaks of Zaolzie!
POL_complete_plan_west코0=Complete Plan West
POL_complete_plan_west_desc코0=The Polish military high command are satisfied that adequate plans have been drawn for the inevitable conflict with the Germans and the time for Plan West has come to an end.
POL_sabotage_polish_industry코0=Sabotage Polish Industry
POL_sabotage_polish_industry_desc코0=Our enemies have far stronger armies than ours and in greater number. While it would be nice to entertain the idea that we shan’t lose ground, the truth is we are unlikely to hold out forever. By rigging our factories and railways with explosives, we may however be able to render them useless to our enemies in the event of an occupation.
POL_plan_east코0=Plan East
POL_plan_east_desc코0=We have been in and out of military conflict with the Russians for centuries and we can safely assume that [SOV.GetLeader] will, like [SOV.GetLeader.GetHerHis] predecessors will attempt an invasion of Poland. They must not succeed this time, plans must be drawn to ensure Poland’s decisive victory over [SOV.GetNameDef]!
POL_eastern_conscripts코0=Eastern Conscripts
POL_eastern_conscripts_desc코0=Many in Eastern Poland sooner identify themselves as Ukrainian or Belorussian than Polish, but they must be convinced to fight nevertheless! While we may find few who would fight for Poland, there are countless among them who would eagerly pick up a rifle against the [SOV.GetAdjective]s!
POL_belorussian_army코0=The Belorussian Army
POL_belorussian_army_desc코0=There are ample independent military groups willing to fight against [SOV.GetNameDef] within Belarus, all that we need do is grant them official recognition and offer them military leadership.
POL_ruthenian_army코0=The Ruthenian Army
POL_ruthenian_army_desc코0=Among Poles and Ukrainians alike, anti-[SOV.GetAdjective] sentiment is palpable in the East. With funding and military leadership, these paramilitarists would be great additions to our armies.
POL_fortification_of_belarus코0=Fortification of the North
POL_fortification_of_belarus_desc코0=The north side of Eastern Poland is little but a series of dense forests with scarcely a trace of civilization among them. This cannot continue to be so in the event of an invasion; these forests must be transformed into a shield against Bolshevism!
POL_fortification_of_ukraine코0=Fortification of Ukraine
POL_fortification_of_ukraine_desc코0=The east is underdeveloped and agrarian, and Polish Ukraine remains a soft spot in Poland’s south primed for an invasion. Some basic fortifications must be constructed along the border if we are to keep our nation safe!
POL_supply_the_rail_nexus코0=Supply the Rail Nexus
POL_supply_the_rail_nexus_desc코0=The railways in Eastern Poland are in a sorry state, not nearly comparable to Poland’s central region. A war with [SOV.GetNameDef] would be won or lost with the control of supply, and a decent supply chain to our own men would be a great place to begin.
POL_local_eastern_plans코0=Local Eastern Plans
POL_local_eastern_plans_desc코0=Often our own military staff can be trusted to devise plans amongst themselves, but in a war like this, direct intervention on a small scale is necessary. Every inch of ground matters, and we must apply our expertise to the smallest of conflicts if we are to halt [SOV.GetAdjective] imperialism!
POL_complete_plan_east코0=Complete Plan East
POL_complete_plan_east_desc코0=The Polish military high command are satisfied that adequate plans have been drawn for the inevitable conflict with the [SOV.GetAdjective] and the time for Plan East has come to an end.
POL_prepare_for_the_inevitable코0=Prepare for the Inevitable
POL_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc코0=We have held out for as long as we can, but with what we have lost, it is time to admit defeat. Poland is gone, but the Polish spirit lives on, and she remains on the prowl even in exile. With enough support from our allies, we shall be capable of fielding an army of exiles, supporting our comrades still resisting occupation back home, and filling our enemy’s ranks with men and women loyal to Poland.
POL_foreign_air_support코0=Foreign Air Support
POL_foreign_air_support_desc코0=With our the assistance from our allies, we may yet be able to field a powerful Polish airforce. Purchasing factories and equipment is merely the beginning of the Polish airforce in exile!
POL_foreign_army_support코0=Foreign Army Support
POL_foreign_army_support_desc코0=With refugees coming from Poland to serve in our ranks every day, we need only provide them with a rifle and they will be prepared to charge up any mountain for the promise of home. All we need do is request further control of our allies’ industry.
POL_aces_in_exile코0=Aces in Exile
POL_aces_in_exile_desc코0=The enemy may have taken our homeland, but our finest pilots still yet fill the air and inspire our men to keep pressing home!
POL_foreign_naval_support코0=Foreign Naval Support
POL_foreign_naval_support_desc코0=What little is left of our navy is in a sorry state. Although we may never be able to restore it to its former glory, support from our sponsors may yet give Polish sailors the means to assist our friends on the sea.
POL_resistance_industries코0=Resistance Industries
POL_resistance_industries_desc코0=Although the homeland is lost, we still need a strong industrial base with which to expand Polish intelligence and develop any ground we reclaim from the enemy.

POL_expand_polish_intelligence코0=Expand Polish Intelligence
POL_expand_polish_intelligence_desc코0=With our armies shattered, defeated, and forced underground, Poland is forced to carry on the struggle from the shadows. We must prioritize rapid expansion of Polish intelligence if there is even to be the faintest hope of returning home.
POL_pomscimy_wawer코0=Pomścimy Wawer
POL_pomscimy_wawer_desc코0=There are whispers coming back to us from the streets of Warsaw that the resistance is preparing for a daring move against the enemy. All across the city, the walls are decorated with foreboding words promising the enemy that we shall have our revenge. It will be difficult, but this uprising may yet be the push we need to finally return home and strike back at the enemy, all the resistance needs is some organization from Polish high command and they may yet succeed…
POL_the_long_push_home코0=The Long Push Home
POL_the_long_push_home_desc코0=The uprising was a success! All that remains now is to hold out long enough for help to arrive. With a populace who have witnessed the absolute horror and brutality of enemy occupation, the Polish army will fight with the vigor of men forty times their number again! This time: we will not fall!
POL_the_north_sea코0=The North Sea
POL_the_north_sea_desc코0=Before we can even begin to consider swaying the neutral powers in the North to join our alliance, we must lay the groundwork on the global diplomatic stage. We must make the northern powers aware of our eagerness to cooperate, and send Józef Beck and his silver tongue to the Nordic countries to convince them of the many benefits of aligning themselves with the Międzymorze.
POL_finno_polish_pact코0=Finno-Polish Pact
POL_finno_polish_pact_desc코0=The Fins are in a similar position to us; stuck on the border with the [SOV.GetAdjective]s who want nothing more than to see their nation subjugated once again into an empire. This makes Finland the ideal candidate for an initial Międzymorze expansion into the Nordic countries.
POL_invite_denmark코0=Invite Denmark
POL_invite_denmark_desc코0=Though a minor power, the Danes control the straits of Denmark, a key strategic region in the Baltic. By aligning the Danish with our faction, we will secure access into and out of the Baltic. The Danes must merely be trusted to survive.
POL_invite_sweden코0=Invite Sweden
POL_invite_sweden_desc코0=The Swedes have had an intriguing concept of neutrality in these times of growing conflict. Perhaps we may be able to sway their foreign ministers that the Intermarium is the most neutral of all alliances in the world and that this mutual offer of defence is their best chance to deter direct intervention from the world’s powers.
POL_invite_norway코0=Invite Norway
POL_invite_norway_desc코0=It is no secret that the Germans have ambitions and designs for Norway, and already there are men within their nation ready to collaborate with these foreign invaders. By extending an invitation to the Intermarium, we are offering the Norwegians the unique opportunity to resist German aggression without bending to them.
POL_the_mediterranean코0=The Mediterranean
POL_the_mediterranean_desc코0=Between Poland and the Mediterranean is a herd of lambs with wolves at their back. Yugoslavia, Austria, even Greece and Turkey are prey to the predatory powers in the West.

POL_coerce_czechoslovakia코0=Defend Czechoslovakia
POL_coerce_czechoslovakia_desc코0=The Czechs and Slovaks are as brothers to Poland, and it is not only in our best interest to protect them, it is our moral imperative.

POL_austro_hungarian_alliance_desc코0=Though the Austro-Hungarians once entrapped the Polish people in their empire, they now stand in the crosshairs of the Germans, all the same as us. Collaboration seems all but inevitable for them, but perhaps if we offer them another option, they will avoid the impulse to hand the keys to their kingdom over to [GER.GetLeader].
POL_protect_yugoslavia코0=Protect Yugoslavia
POL_protect_yugoslavia_desc코0=Yugoslavia is in a sorry state, and they are prime target for invasion by almost all of their neighbours. We must invite them to the Międzymorze for protection from threats both inside and outside their borders.
POL_invite_greece코0=Invite Greece
POL_invite_greece_desc코0=The tension between Greece and Turkey remains strong, and with a potential Italian invasion on the horizon, the Greeks could no-doubt benefit from our protection.
POL_control_the_bosporus코0=Control the Bosporus
POL_control_the_bosporus_desc코0=The Romanian alliance is utterly meaningless if we are powerless to move armies and navies through the Bosporus strait. Turkey is of vital strategic interest to our nation and they must be convinced to cooperate.
POL_italian_alliance코0=Italian Alliance
POL_italian_alliance_desc코0=The Italian government have made it no secret that they are an enemy to the ideals of self-determination that the Międzymorze represents, but with appropriate changes to both the Polish and Italian internal governments, we may be able to align them with our vision for the future of Europe.
POL_anti_blitz_vehicles코0=Anti-Blitz Vehicles
POL_anti_blitz_vehicles_desc코0=Our enemies would seek to overrun us with overwhelming waves of armored divisions. We are unlikely to be able to match enemy tanks, but we can however invest in weaponry designed specifically to break vehicles at great expense to the enemy.
POL_clamp_down_on_danzig코0=Clamp Down on Danzig
POL_clamp_down_on_danzig_desc코0=Officially, Danzig is a free city under Polish protection, but as of late, the city has fallen into Nazi control and is a puppet to Adolf Hitler in all but name. This blemish on our Northern border is nothing but an obstruction to Polish trade and we must reassert control over the city, or risk crumbling to the Germans.
POL_attract_poles_to_gdynia코0=Attract Poles to Gdynia
POL_attract_poles_to_gdynia_desc코0=A great seaport needs great men to run it, and there are countless Poles awaiting employment. By encouraging migration to Gdynia, we may continue our development project of the seaport.
POL_ban_the_nazi_party코0=Ban the Nazi Party
POL_ban_the_nazi_party_desc코1=We have garnered enough support among the populace of Gdańsk that we may officially purge the city of Nazis and reclaim the city for the Polish state!

POL_expand_gdynia_seaport_desc코0=Now that Gdynia has been developed into a great trading city to rival Danzig, all that remains is to officially open the city for trade and our economy will once again be ours and ours alone to control!
POL_integrate_gdansk_industries코1=Integrate Gdańsk Industries
POL_integrate_gdansk_industries_desc코1=For decades, Gdańsk has been separated from the rest of the nation, but no more! By integrating Gdańsk into our administration, we will be able to reclaim control of our exports and imports!
POL_expand_northern_rail코0=Expand Northern Rail
POL_expand_northern_rail_desc코0=All Polish goods must enter and exit through the North, but the infrastructure there is far from what it could be. The North must be given proper railway infrastructure.
POL_join_allies코0=Join the Allies
POL_join_allies_desc코0=The future of [Root.GetNameDef] exists in the hands of our old allies in the West. Though we are already affiliated with the Allies, officially joining them shall affirm our commitment to the West, and hopefully the West’s commitment to Poland in turn.

POL_great_peasants_strike코0=The Peasant's Strike
POL_great_peasants_strike_desc코0=The lack of action by the government has led to mass-protests across the countryside!

POL_protect_czechozlovakia_desc코0=It has become apparent that [GER.GetLeader] has [Ger.GetLeader.GetHerHis] own plan for the fate of Czechoslovakia; one which will leave the Czechoslovakians without their independence. This tide of imperialism must be halted.

POL_romanian_alliance코0=Romanian Alliance
POL_romanian_alliance_desc코0=We have held a longstanding alliance with the Romanians, an alliance between the seas, and while historically this has meant very little, it is time that we extend a formal invitation to the Romanians to join our faction and bring the Intermarium ambition to fruition.
