TUR_rearmament_scheme_desc코0=A comprehensive rearmament scheme has been in the pipeline for quite some time now, but there was little need to carry out the scheme - but the world now finds itself on the brink of another war, and Turkey will not be caught unprepared.
TUR_infrastructure_privatised_idea코0=Privatized Infrastructure
TUR_infrastructure_privatised_idea_desc코0=Giving private interests some control over our state's infrastructure gives us some more resources to allocate elsewhere, but makes building additional infrastructure an irritatingly staggered affair for now.
TUR_financing_private_enterprise코0=Financing Private Enterprise
TUR_financing_private_enterprise_desc코1=It is the purpose of the state to provide incentive and reward for the most entrepreneurial of our people. By investing in those who would better our nation, we invest in the future of our country.
TUR_etatism코0=Etatism
TUR_etatism_desc코2=Our mixed economy is unlike any in the world: it has elements of British liberalism, Italian corporatism, and Soviet central planning. It is the ultimate synthesis of economic models and a crowning jewel of the Kemalist system. \n\n§RIf we advance our economy law, then we should be prepared for friction to develop between our incompatible economic models.§!
TUR_etatism_2코0=Etatism
TUR_etatism_2_desc코2=Our mixed economy is unlike any in the world: it has elements of British liberalism, Italian corporatism, and Soviet central planning. It is the ultimate synthesis of economic models and a crowning jewel of the Kemalist system, but we must be sure not to put too much pressure on it by trying to simutaneously sustain a war economy. \n\n§RIf we advance our economy law, then we should be prepared for additional friction to develop between our incompatible economic models.§!
TUR_etatism_3코0=Etatism
TUR_etatism_3_desc코2=Our mixed economy is unlike any in the world: it has elements of British liberalism, Italian corporatism, and Soviet central planning. It is the ultimate synthesis of economic models and was a crowning jewel of the Kemalist system, but we have strained it by attempting to concurrently sustain a war economy. We might need to reconsider our prospects and end the Etatist experiment. \n\n§RIf we advance our economy law, then we should be prepared for additional friction to develop between our incompatible economic models.§!
TUR_etatism_4코0=Etatism
TUR_etatism_4_desc코2=Our mixed economy was unlike any in the world: it subsisted of elements of British liberalism, Italian corporatism, and Soviet central planning. We have been reckless and greedy, and we risk destroying our country's economy by trying to keep our Etatist model while running a war economy. We risk everything for nothing: we must abolish Etatism before it becomes too late. \n\n§RIf we advance our economy law again without abolishing Etatism then we will trigger a depression!§!
TUR_economic_collapse코0=Economic Collapse
TUR_economic_collapse_desc코1=We are ruined: Etatism saved us the pains of the Great Depression, but we could not evade economic catastrophe forever it seems. We have failed our country, our people, our ideology, and we have tainted the legacy of Atatürk himself forever...
TUR_etatism_stabilisation코0=Etatist Stabilization
TUR_etatism_stabilisation_desc코1=The beauty of a mixed economy is that we have the capacity and power to implement emergency measures when the need arises, and we have done just that. We have bought time before the next economic shift, but it will not last forever. We must use our time carefully.
kemalist_neutrality_idea코0=Kemalist Neutrality
kemalist_neutrality_idea_desc코1=Peace at Home, Peace in the World - Atatürk decreed it, and we have now codified it as the very basis of our foreign policy. We must keep the peace, and if we cannot have peace in the world then we will just have to settle for peace at home.

TUR_investment_financing_spirit코0=Financing Investment
TUR_investment_financing_spirit_desc코1=The world revolves around the exchange of commodities for the fulfillment of needs. We certainly have need, but in order to have our back scratched we must first do a bit of back-scratching ourselves.
TUR_sheltered_foreign_outcasts코0=Sheltered Foreign Outcasts
TUR_sheltered_foreign_outcasts_desc코0=It is our moral imperative to help the persecuted peoples of the world when it is within our power, and thus far it most certainly has been in our power. We will naturalize them, protect them, and nurture them as though they were native sons and daughters of [TUR.GetNameDef].
TUR_debt_council코0=Debt Council
TUR_debt_council_desc코1=When the Ottoman Empire was finally confined to the history books, it left us a parting gift: its colossal debt. We owe a great deal of money and assets to the Western powers, but most humiliatingly of all our debt is not even managed here in our country. The Debt Council, in all its infinite wisdom, convenes in France.
TUR_tpda코0=TPDA
TUR_tpda_desc코1=At last, we have wrestled the reins away from the imperialists and can organize and manage our own debts from our capital city. The Debt Council is no more, now the privileged sharks will have no choice but to come to us when they seek restitution or capitulation.
TUR_tpda_absorbed코0=Turkish Public Debt Administration
TUR_tpda_absorbed_desc코1=With only the stroke of a pen, the Turkish Public Debt Administration has turned from a private entity into a state-owned public entity. We administer our debt, we control our debt, and we can diminish our debt. We have risen high in the world.
TUR_debt_council_reined_in_flag코0=The foreign Debt Council has been reorganized into a national institution
TUR_varlik_vergisi_spirit코0=Varlık Vergisi
TUR_varlik_vergisi_spirit_desc코1=This 'Wealth Tax' is only a thinly veiled reimplementation of the Jizya tax, and we might need to consider repealing it before we lose even the illusion of administering a secular republic.
TUR_inanc_vergisi_spirit코1=İnanç Vergisi
TUR_inanc_vergisi_spirit_desc코1=The 'Faith Tax' is the ultimate culmination of Kemalist secular doctrine; it is an aggressive push that many will consider as a big step towards state atheism. Unfortunately, it is a dream that cannot be - and we will have to consider repealing the tax in the future.
TUR_political_landscape_shifting코0=Political Landscape Shifting
TUR_political_landscape_shifting_desc코1=For so long, it has been the ultimate aim of Kemalism to establish a multi-party liberal democracy in [TUR.GetNameDef]... but times change. We live in exciting times with modern ideologies battling it out with each other for supremacy over the world order, and it seems that ideological battleground has found its footing here now too.
TUR_the_redshirts코0=The Redshirts
TUR_the_redshirts_desc코1=The Redshirts are our very own paramilitary fascist militia that patrol the streets of our urban areas and ensure people are strictling abiding by the principles of Kemalism. They might be a little violent at times, with hearts of iron and heads filled with revolutionary idealism, but at least their cause is just!
TUR_turkish_workers_militia코0=Turkish Workers' Militia
TUR_turkish_workers_militia_desc코1=The people in the best position to protect the rights of workers are the workers themselves. Of course, a little direction from our government and the odd memo from Moscow only better their effectiveness as a workers' militia.
TUR_turkish_interventionism코0=Turkish Interventionism
TUR_turkish_interventionism_desc코1=Peace at Home, Peace in the World - Atatürk decreed it, and we have now codified it as the very basis of our foreign policy. We can no longer sit by and allow the world to fall into turmoil while we stand on the sidelines and do nothing. The only way to secure our peace at home is to fight for peace in the world.
TUR_balkan_defense_council_spirit코0=Balkan Defense Council
TUR_balkan_defense_council_spirit_desc코0=Delegations from every member of the Balkan Entente regularly meet to exchange anecdotes about events in the world and updates on their respective defensive situations. Our shared pool of militaristic knowledge is a great boon to us all.

TUR_three_year_plan_balkans_desc코1=The Balkan Entente has undertaken one of the boldest industrialization projects in history by sponsoring a jointly-funded multinational centrally planned economic scheme to make sure our industrial bases are collectively powerful enough to withstand an assault from a great power.
TUR_central_balkan_bank_wealthy_greece코0=The Central Balkan Bank of Athens
TUR_central_balkan_bank_wealthy_greece_desc코1=Nobody ever could have predicted that [GRE.GetNameDef] of all countries would be the first one of us to get their financial affairs in such immaculate shape.

TUR_central_balkan_bank코0=The Balkan Central Bank
TUR_central_balkan_bank_desc코1=The Balkan Central Bank shall be a forum for the freeflow of materials, commodities, and matters related to commerce for all the nations in the Balkan Pact. Izmir, with time, shall come to rival Frankfurt, Shanghai, and New York as centers of business and trade.
TUR_joint_fortification_budget코0=Joint Fortification Budget
TUR_joint_fortification_budget_desc코1=The Balkan Entente is like a stack of dominoes: when one of us falls, the rest will surely be quick to follow. We must all take responsibility for our defense and prepare our borders against any possible incursions.
TUR_emergency_fortification_directive코0=Emergency Fortification Directive
TUR_emergency_fortification_directive_desc코1=Dire times call for dire measures, and we have been forced to quickly allocate resources towards building fortifications. Our very existence could be at stake.
TUR_united_balkan_security_forces코0=United Balkan Security Forces
TUR_united_balkan_security_forces_desc코1=Shared security batallions is a natural escalation from frequently having our members of high command exchange battleplans and intel with each other. By alleviating some of the pressure on us for policing our internal borders, we lessen the loads on our national armies and become better prepared for war.
TUR_the_coordinated_armed_forces_of_the_balkan_pact코0=The Coordinated Armed Forces of the Balkan Entente
TUR_the_coordinated_armed_forces_of_the_balkan_pact_desc코0=Our strength stems from our unity. We coordinate as one, we fight as one, we fall as one. When the dust settles and the cannons stop firing, the Balkan Entente will still be standing.
TUR_balkan_pact_innovative_transport_techniques코0=Balkan-wide Innovative Transport Techniques
TUR_balkan_pact_innovative_transport_techniques_desc코1=To better coordinate and facilitate the easy transport of our armies across our many borders, we must as a collective of nations improve our infrastructure. This initiative will hopefully go some lengths in alleviating this hurdle.
TUR_victory_at_all_costs코0=Victory At All Costs
TUR_victory_at_all_costs_desc코0=We did not fight tooth and nail as a nation during our War of Independence only to be annihilated a few decades later. No, [TUR.GetNameDef]'s story does not end here - we must not fall, we will not fall!

TUR_tuz_golu_training_facility_desc코1=Our nation's Mediterranean climate is not a fit environment to train our soldiers so they can adequetely operate in arid climates. We have elected to erect training facility close to the Tuz Gölü salt lake, so that our troops might be better prepared to fight in desiccated environments.
TUR_sub_zero_survival_training코0=Sub-Zero Survival Training
TUR_sub_zero_survival_training_desc코1=It is no easy task emulating some of the bitter colds of Eurasia, but he have been forced to make do.

TUR_italo_turkish_merchant_fleet코0=Italo-[TUR.GetAdjective] Merchant Fleet

TUR_refugees_from_the_fascist_menace_desc코1=The fascists practice politics of exclusivity and violate the inalienable rights of man at every turn. Their actions are monsterous, and safeguarding and protecting those fleeing fascist prejudice is the very least that we can do.
TUR_revolutionary_brigades_from_abroad코0=Revolutionary Brigades From Abroad
TUR_revolutionary_brigades_from_abroad_desc코1=Marxism is a fundamentally internationalist creed and so it is merely natural that revolutionaries from all across the world would flock to our nation to fight in our shared global struggle.

TUR_construct_a_red_navy_desc코0=Without the backing of a strong naval backbone, any attempts to spread a global revolution is doomed to fail.
TUR_the_revolutionary_officer_college_of_kars코0=The Revolutionary Officer College of Kars
TUR_the_revolutionary_officer_college_of_kars_desc코1=Kars is a city with a storied history, and its proximity to [SOV.GetNameDef] makes it the ideal location to establish a new politicized officer school.

TUR_turkish_bolshevism코0=Turkish Bolshevism
TUR_turkish_bolshevism_desc코1=Kemalism served its purpose and now will be consigned to the history books... well, some illegal history books at any rate. [TUR.GetNameDef] is now modelled upon Vladimir Lenin's revolution rather than the revisionist reactionary Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his quashed movement.
TUR_reappropriated_exploitative_finance코0=Reappropriated Exploitative Finance
TUR_reappropriated_exploitative_finance_desc코1=We shall repurpose the wealth of foreign usurers and our own deplorable domestic capitalistic parasites in order to build a society that truly serves the working class of [TUR.GetNameDef].

TUR_the_battle_for_our_nations_survival_desc코1=The unthinkable has happened: [SOV.GetNameDef] has invaded our nation, and now the future of the [TUR.GetAdjective] state is at stake. The [TUR.GetAdjective] people have rallied to the call of [TUR.GetLeader], but in the face of total war against an indisputably more powerful threat just how long can this zeal last?
TUR_rebuilding_our_home코0=Rebuilding Our Home
TUR_rebuilding_our_home_desc코1=Our nation has been materially, physically, and spiritually ravaged by the Kemalist dogs, but at long last their tyranny has been brought to an end.

TUR_rising_islamist_dissidence_desc코1=Every time the very notion of free elections has been raised in [TUR.GetNameDef] the religious fundamentalists have tried to hijack any platform for opposition to the CHP.

TUR_objectors_flocking_to_military_service_desc코1=All sorts of [TUR.GetAdjective] citizens who once dodged conscription are signing up to serve in our armed forces.

TUR_legacy_of_ataturk_fulfilled_desc코0=We have championed and fulfilled Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's highest ambitions for the [ROOT.GetAdjective] state by transforming it into a legitimate multi-party liberal democratic state.

TUR_legacy_of_ataturk_preserved_desc코0=We have prolonged the status quo of old by maintaining an authoritarian regime that promotes Kemalist ideals.

TUR_legacy_of_ataturk_defiled코0=The Legacy of Atatürk
TUR_legacy_of_ataturk_defiled_desc코0=We have failed him: how could the Father of the Turks look upon the current state of affairs in [ROOT.GetNameDef] with anything other than scornful disdain? We shall just have to trust that his ambitions for this nation were wrong, and that ours were right...

BUL_imro_02코0=IMRO

BUL_tsar_boris_negative_01_desc코0=Boris III knows that his dictatorial regime is coming to an end and, unsurprisingly, he refuses to accept any changes proposed by our ministers, appealing to loyalist members in the government to derail all of our proposals and desperately trying to keep control of Bulgarian politics for as long as he can.

BUL_zveno_ns_desc코0=The dissolution of the Military Union was a necessary matter, but it has had its consequences: we finally got rid of several Zveno individuals who were doing nothing more than hindering the chain of command, but we also lost valuable instructors and experienced officers at our military academies.
